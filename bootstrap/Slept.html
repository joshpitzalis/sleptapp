    <div id="blurb"> Do you long for more sleep? Do you just put up with it? Would you like to do something about it?

        All you need to do is synchronise your breathing to the soft rhythmic light and the App will help you fall asleep in record time.

        Make sure your bedroom is dark, place your phone beside your bed, lie on your back and stare at the ceiling as you synchronise your breath with the App's lighting.

        Once your eyes start to droop you can shut your eyes and let your bodies natural breathing take over.

        BONUS: The App is completely silent which means it works without having to use ear phones and, if you share your bed, it won't disturb your partner.</div>
